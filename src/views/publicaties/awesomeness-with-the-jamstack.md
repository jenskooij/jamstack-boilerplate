This talk discusses the JAMStack and it’s possibilities following an example I’ve realised over the past months as a side project. Join me on the journey of a small startup that aims to make awesomeness achievable for everyone. Whether you’re a developer interested in fullstack development or an entrepreneur looking for inspiration, this talk hopes to inspire everyone, technical and non-technical alike. It will discuss why an idea is only worth as much as your power to execute it, providing a complete walkthrough of the project from conceptual idea to finished product.
